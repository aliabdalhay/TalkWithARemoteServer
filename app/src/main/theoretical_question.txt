implementation a:

pro: when we save the token locally, we avoid asking it from the server every time, which is an expensive request.
con: if we save the user token for reuse we are risking our users, because someone might get access to this token
and can use our user information. if we don't save the token it's less of a risk

implementation b:

pro: less risk for stealing our user information since we do not save the token anywhere
cons: expensive request each time, makes the user wait to get his/her information
